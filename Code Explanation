  *+***************        let’s break down the code step by step       ***************************

1] Imports:
import tkinter as tk: Imports the Tkinter library, which is used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) for the game.
import random: Imports the random module, which is used for generating random numbers for adding new tiles.

2] Class Definition (Game2048):
This class represents the 2048 game. It contains methods and attributes to manage the game state and handle user input.

3] __init__ method:
Initializes the game instance.
Sets up the game window (master), title, size, and event binding for key presses.
Initializes game variables such as the grid size, grid state, and score.
Calls init_grid() to set up the initial grid GUI.
Calls add_tile() to add the first tile to the grid.
Calls update_grid() to update the GUI with the initial grid state.

4] init_grid method:
Initializes the GUI grid by creating Tkinter labels for each cell and placing them in a grid layout within the game window.

5] add_tile method:
Adds a new tile (either 2 or 4 with probabilities 0.9 and 0.1, respectively) to a random empty cell on the grid.

6] update_grid method:
Updates the GUI grid labels with the current state of the grid.

7] handle_key method:
Handles user key presses.
Moves the tiles in the grid according to the arrow key pressed.
Adds a new tile after each move.
Updates the GUI grid.
Checks for game over condition and prints the score if the game is over.

8] move_tiles method:
Moves the tiles in the grid based on the direction specified (Up, Down, Left, Right).
Uses helper methods transpose, reverse, and merge_tiles for grid manipulation.

9] merge_tiles method:
Merges adjacent tiles with the same value and updates the score accordingly.

10] check_game_over method:
Checks if the game is over by looking for any empty cells or adjacent tiles with the same value.

11] Helper Methods:
transpose: Transposes a matrix (used for rotating the grid).
reverse: Reverses the rows of a matrix (used for flipping the grid horizontally).

12] main function:
Creates a Tkinter root window and initializes the game.

13] if __name__ == "__main__": block:

Ensures that the main function is executed when the script is run directly, but not when it’s imported as a module.
